\subsection*{Coding Style}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
\item 80 character line length
\item Use {\ttfamily Type$\ast$ foo} not {\ttfamily Type $\ast$foo}.
\item Align parameters passed to functions.
\item Prefer {\ttfamily folly\+::make\+\_\+unique$<$Foo$>$} to {\ttfamily new Foo}. In general, we discourage use of raw {\ttfamily new} or {\ttfamily delete}.
