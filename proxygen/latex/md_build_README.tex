Continuous integration builds are powered by {\ttfamily \doxyref{fbcode\+\_\+builder}{p.}{namespacefbcode__builder}}, a tiny tool shared by several Facebook projects. Its files are in {\ttfamily ./fbcode\+\_\+builder} (on Github) or in {\ttfamily fbcode/opensource/fbcode\+\_\+builder} (inside Facebook\textquotesingle{}s repo).

Start with the R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+Es in the {\ttfamily \doxyref{fbcode\+\_\+builder}{p.}{namespacefbcode__builder}} directory.

{\ttfamily ./fbcode\+\_\+builder\+\_\+config.py} contains the project-\/specific configuration.
